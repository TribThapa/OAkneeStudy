# OA Knee Study


### This repository contains all scripts used to analyse data in the OA Knee Study.  

#### Briefly:

The aim of this study was to determine whether there were any differences in functional connectivity between those with and without chronic knee osteoarthritis pain. 

We used time-series data obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest.
